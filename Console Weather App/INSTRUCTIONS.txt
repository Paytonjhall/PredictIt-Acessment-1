I enjoyed working through this mini assessment. It was good to cement what I have been learning on my own.
I struggled a bit on parsing the API response body into a usable form. I found the best way was to create a class to cast the response to. 

This project was very tricky to run locally. I tried for about an hour to get things running but always ran into .NET version errors.
I have installed the latest version (8.*.*) but the project errored and said it can only run on 5.*.*. I installed version 5 several times but still could not run it.
I eventually gave up and finish the rest of the assessment in about an hour. 

Thank you for your time in reviewing my code. I am excited to hear back from PredictIt.
